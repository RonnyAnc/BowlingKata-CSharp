## SOLUTION 2

This solution appears because one day my friend Dani Ojeda (playing bowling) realized that when you make an strike or
a spare the next roll value is multiplied by 2. After that, we wanted to implement the kata without loosing that point of
view. 

## CONCLUSION

After resolved it. I am not really happy with the result. Implement it was really easy but it was really difficult to me
improve the code without extract some states to avoid multiple parameters in my methods. This solution is less object 
oriented and the most important it is difficult to represent the domain with the code (at least without generate
useless code). In my opinion, it is not a great solution but we wanted to test it.
